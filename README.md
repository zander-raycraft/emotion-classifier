<h2>Human emotion classifier - Personal Project</h2>

![Production Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Production%20State-In%20Progress-orange)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a ML-based emotion classifier meant to demonstrate my proficiency with multiple Python machine libraries and TensorFlow's C++ package, as well as my ability to construct and fit a neural network to data. This high-level idea is that this program connects to a device that feeds in a stream of input, such as a laptop camera, and takes that input and uses the model to predict what emotion is being expressed by the stream. 

The Model training and construction are built in Python while the Camera interaction is built in C++ for faster processing times.


<h2>To run</h2>

```
cd NN_traing
python3 train.py
```

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
The data the model was trained on was provided as open-source data thanks to Kaggle. You can find the link to the data as a comment in the top of the file "train.py".
